The Tower of Sakuru

I have creatd a speed platformer game, in which, precise movements and skill is required to scale the tower's many platforms. One slip and you are sent back to the start.

Control the player using the W,A,S,D controls, and jump using the spacebar. W (forward), A (strafe left), S (Back), D (strafe right), and SPACE (Jump).

The mouse is used to direct the position the player is facing, and only with a keen grasp on these controls can one reach the top of the tower.

Enjoy, and it is possible to win...
